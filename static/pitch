Other features:

Lower friction - it's so cheap, pay on my behalf. Every time a new coursera video comes out. Everytime I save a video to my youtube playlist. 
Sub one line at a time - there's a company already doing this

General principle:

Public service requests. Everyone will benefit. Why no one do it now? Why so few volunteers? Tragedy of the commons

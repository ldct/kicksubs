00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,010
Hello everyone and we'll come to this class
on quantum mannings and computers.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,069
Come rotation my name is mesh vary runny
and I'm am approve at the university of

3
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:16,014
Californians at Berkeley here. At birch Lee
we are very excited to be part of this.

4
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:21,087
Evolutionary inn education. Breathing, cutting,
edge courses; to any one in any part of the

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:28,064
word. So what? Is comptom communication?
Quantum communication. It's a very young feel.

6
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:35,008
Which is paste on? The disparity that
computer systems can be axed potentially

7
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:42,013
powerful. I'll see a lot more about. This is
in a subsequent video. but in this video I

8
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:48,084
want to talk about the format of the
course. The course is offered over eight

9
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:55,009
weeks followed by a final exam. The
material will be presented through a

10
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:01,093
series of short videos, which will be
augmented with inline quizzes to help you

11
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:08,075
reinforce your understanding of the
material. There will be seven problem

12
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:15,064
sets, each, each worth ten percent of the
score. And the problem sets will, will

13
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:21,069
have, mainly multiple choice, and
questions with numeric answers, which you

14
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:27,057
will turn in. To make sure that you
understand the material really well, we

15
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:33,078
will allow you to, make multiple attempts
at the problem sets. After your first

16
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:40,066
attempt, every subsequent attempt will be,
penalized ten%. If you want to understand

17
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:47,049
the material at greater depth, we'll also
include optional long questions. These you

18
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:53,781
do not have to turn in, but you're welcome
to discuss these with your fellow students

19
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:59,617
in, online forums which I'll talk about
later. The final 30 percent of your score

20
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:06,996
will be based on the final exam which is,
which you can think of as a particularly

21
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:12,880
long problem set. Okay, so what is the
required background for this course? So,

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,591
this course has been carefully designed to
make it accessible to students from a

23
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:26,130
multiple of backgrounds including Computer
Science, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics,

24
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,967
etc. And so, we've tried to minimize the
number of requirements for this course.

25
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:39,245
So, in particular, I'll not assume any
prior knowledge of quantum mechanics. But

26
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:46,289
to take this course, you will need to have
a thoroug h understanding of basic linear

27
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:52,245
Algebra. What I mean by that is, simple
concepts such as vectors and matrices,

28
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:58,556
orthogonal bases, inner products, igon
values and igon vectors. To help you

29
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:04,448
review your knowledge of this material,
we, we will, we will include some sort of

30
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:10,557
supplementary material and, and perhaps a
video about this, about this subject. I'll

31
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:17,288
also assume very basic knowledge of
computer science. Things such as the big O

32
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:23,458
notation, or some elementary algorithms,
but particularly, how you analyze the

33
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:29,307
running time of algorithms by counting the
number of steps. There are few other

34
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:35,192
important issues we should go through.
This class has an honor code. This is the

35
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:42,520
same kind of honor code we have for our,
in class students here, in Berkeley. So,

36
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,358
you are allowed to, discuss the material
in this course, in fact, you're encouraged

37
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:50,332
to the discuss the material in this
course, with your fellow students. You can

38
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:56,015
even discuss the problem sets with your
fellow students, you know, to ask

39
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:02,808
clarifying questions, etc. But the answers
that you turn in have to be your own. In

40
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:09,591
addition, we'll request that you, not
distribute online the problem sets or any

41
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:16,570
of the answers, that we post. This is so
that, in subsequent offerings of these, of

42
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,926
this course, the students are allowed to
work independently on these questions.

43
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:30,570
I'll be posting course notes, every week.
You should think of this as a text book

44
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,629
for the class. This brings us to the
question of time management. So, you

45
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,035
should expect to spend anywhere from five
to twelve or more hours per week on this

46
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:47,447
course. Depending, of course, on the kind
of background you bring to this, to this

47
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:52,545
course, and also the depth to which you
want to understand the material. So, the

48
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:57,463
material is going to be formulated so
that, you can understand it, either at a

49
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,290
high level, or if you want to, you can use
this material as a spring book, to

50
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:08,082
understanding the various aspects of this
material at a greater depth. The course

51
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:14,162
notes will help you to do this, as well
the optional problem sets. There' s one

52
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:19,688
other important point, which is that
there's an online discussion forum for

53
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:24,563
this class, which will allow you to
interact with your fellow students. This

54
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:29,515
is a very important part of this class.
This will make it more fun for you, but

55
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:34,456
it'll also allow you to understand the
material at a greater depth. We also

56
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:40,213
encourage to form study groups, either
physically or through this online forum.

57
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:46,113
Okay, so, what will you learn in this
class. So, as I mentioned, one of the key

58
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:52,562
aspects of quantum computation is the
exponential power of quantum systems. So,

59
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:59,222
in this course you'll learn, what is the
source of this power? And how can you use

60
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:05,443
this source? How can you exploit this
power to design quantum algorithms? By the

61
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:10,621
end of this course, you'll, you'll
understand several iconic quantum

62
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:15,823
algorithms, including the quantum
algorithm for factoring integers

63
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:22,615
efficiently. You'll also learn what are
the limitations of the power of quantum

64
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:28,922
mechanics. In order to do all this, you
have to, have an, understanding of the

65
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:35,570
basic, of basic quantum mechanics, and so
another way to view this course is as a

66
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:42,884
simple and conceptional introduction to
the basic elements of quantum mechanics.

67
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:48,025
Okay. So, I look forward to having you in,
in this course.
